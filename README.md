# Event-based-analytics
In this project, I will investigate user behavior for a company's app - a startup that sells food products. I will use a dataset the information on actions users made on the app (events), throughout an A/B test that was conducted.
in order to reach conclusions, I will do the following:
1. Download and explore the data
2. Prepare the data for analysis
3. Study and check the data
4. Study the event funnel
5. Study the results of the experiment

# Skills demonstrated :
1. Data preparation and analysis using pandas 
2. Event funnels visualisation and analysis with:
